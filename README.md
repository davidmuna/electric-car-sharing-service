# Research Question

-Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month of April 2018.
# Bonus Questions (Optional)

-What is the most popular hour for returning cars?
-What station is the most popular?

Studying the given dataset, I analysed the data and gave recommendations for business success to the electric car sharing company in a Data Report report which comprised the following sections;

I used the CRISP-DM methodology to guide me while working on the Data Report. My Data Report has an objective account, with insights majorly coming from analysis of the the datasets provided using Pandas.
